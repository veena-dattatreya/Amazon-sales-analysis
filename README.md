# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

```sql
CREATE TABLE category
(
  category_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  category_name VARCHAR(20)
);

-- customers TABLE
CREATE TABLE customers
(
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  first_name	VARCHAR(20),
  last_name	VARCHAR(20),
  state VARCHAR(20),
  address VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT ('xxxx')
);

-- sellers TABLE
CREATE TABLE sellers
(
  seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_name	VARCHAR(25),
  origin VARCHAR(15)
);

-- products table
  CREATE TABLE products
  (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  product_name VARCHAR(50),	
  price	FLOAT,
  cogs	FLOAT,
  category_id INT, -- FK 
  CONSTRAINT product_fk_category FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

-- orders
CREATE TABLE orders
(
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 	
  order_date	DATE,
  customer_id	INT, -- FK
  seller_id INT, -- FK 
  order_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_sellers FOREIGN KEY (seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items
(
  order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,	-- FK 
  product_id INT, -- FK
  quantity INT,	
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- payment TABLE
CREATE TABLE payments
(
  payment_id	
  INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT, -- FK 	
  payment_date DATE,
  payment_status VARCHAR(20),
  CONSTRAINT payments_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE shippings
(
  shipping_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id	INT, -- FK
  shipping_date DATE,	
  return_date	 DATE,
  shipping_providers	VARCHAR(15),
  delivery_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT shippings_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory
(
  inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT, -- FK
  stock INT,
  warehouse_id INT,
  last_stock_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT inventory_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
  );
```

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:
1. Top Selling Products
Query the top 10 products by total sales value.
Challenge: Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.

```sql
SELECT 
	oi.product_id,
	p.product_name,
	SUM(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
	COUNT(o.order_id)  as total_orders
FROM orders as o
JOIN
order_items as oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN 
products as p
ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10
```

2. Revenue by Category
Calculate total revenue generated by each product category.
Challenge: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.

```sql
SELECT 
	p.category_id,
	c.category_name,
	SUM(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
	SUM(oi.total_sale)/
					(SELECT SUM(total_sale) FROM order_items) 
					* 100
	as contribution
FROM order_items as oi
JOIN
products as p
ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN category as c
ON c.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

3. Average Order Value (AOV)
Compute the average order value for each customer.
Challenge: Include only customers with more than 5 orders.

```sql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
	CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ',  c.last_name) as full_name,
	SUM(total_sale)/COUNT(o.order_id) as AOV,
	COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders --- filter
FROM orders as o
JOIN 
customers as c
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN 
order_items as oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING  COUNT(o.order_id) > 5
```

4. Monthly Sales Trend
Query monthly total sales over the past year.
Challenge: Display the sales trend, grouping by month, return current_month sale, last month sale!

```sql
SELECT 
	year,
	month,
	total_sale as current_month_sale,
	LAG(total_sale, 1) OVER(ORDER BY year, month) as last_month_sale
FROM ---
(
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) as month,
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) as year,
	ROUND(
			SUM(oi.total_sale::numeric)
			,2) as total_sale
FROM orders as o
JOIN
order_items as oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY year, month
) as t1
```


5. Customers with No Purchases
Find customers who have registered but never placed an order.
Challenge: List customer details and the time since their registration.

```sql
Approach 1
SELECT *
	-- reg_date - CURRENT_DATE
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT 
					DISTINCT customer_id
				FROM orders
				);
```
```sql
-- Approach 2
SELECT *
FROM customers as c
LEFT JOIN
orders as o
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.customer_id IS NULL
```

6. Least-Selling Categories by State
Identify the least-selling product category for each state.
Challenge: Include the total sales for that category within each state.

```sql
WITH ranking_table
AS
(
SELECT 
	c.state,
	cat.category_name,
	SUM(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY c.state ORDER BY SUM(oi.total_sale) ASC) as rank
FROM orders as o
JOIN 
customers as c
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN
order_items as oi
ON o.order_id = oi. order_id
JOIN 
products as p
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN
category as cat
ON cat.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
*
FROM ranking_table
WHERE rank = 1
```
